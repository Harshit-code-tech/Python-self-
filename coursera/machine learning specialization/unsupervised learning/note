k means cluster
l2norm
if any cluster has 0 centroids.. eliminate the cluster..or alternative is randomly reinitialize...
what k means algorightm is doing is trying to find assignments of points of clusters centroids as well as find location of clusters centroids that minimizes the squared distance...
the move cluster centroid in k means formula tries to minimize the distortion

run multipel time to find best local optima for k value... in random initialization

to choose best value of k we can use elbow method(altough not recommanded)
